//Quarter of the year
// Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.
// For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.
// Constraint:
// 1 <= month <= 12

const quarterOf = (month) => {
    return Math.floor(month / 4);
};

console.log(quarterOf(3)); //1
console.log(quarterOf(8)); //3
console.log(quarterOf(11)); //3
